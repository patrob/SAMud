description: Kick off multiple parallel research agents.

For each of the following lines, run the codebase-analyzer agent in parallel (one for each) and run the exact prompt in that agent:
`/research ANSI escape sequences and VT100 terminal control for creating static HUDs and scrolling regions in telnet applications. Focus on cursor positioning, screen regions, and color management techniques that work reliably across different terminal clients. ultrathink`
`/research Node.js terminal UI frameworks like blessed.js, terminal-kit, and alternatives for building complex graphical interfaces over telnet connections. Compare features, performance, and compatibility for real-time game applications. ultrathink`
`/research Telnet protocol enhancements including option negotiation (NAWS, MCCP2), proper line ending handling, and client capability detection. Focus on implementing robust telnet features for enhanced terminal graphics support. ultrathink`
`/research ASCII art generation, management, and rendering systems for game environments. Explore tools, libraries, and techniques for creating, storing, and dynamically displaying ASCII graphics in terminal applications. ultrathink`
`/research Terminal-based game UI patterns including persistent status bars, inventory displays, maps, and interactive menus. Study successful implementations and design patterns for immersive terminal game experiences. ultrathink`
`/research Performance optimization techniques for real-time terminal graphics including delta updates, frame rate limiting, and efficient ANSI sequence batching. Focus on maintaining responsiveness with multiple concurrent telnet sessions. ultrathink`
`/research Terminal client compatibility testing across PuTTY, Terminal.app, SSH clients, and mobile telnet apps. Identify common limitations, workarounds, and graceful degradation strategies for graphical terminal applications. ultrathink`
`/research Advanced input handling in terminal applications including raw mode, keypress events, and maintaining input functionality while preserving complex display layouts. Focus on telnet-compatible approaches. ultrathink`
`/research Game mechanics and features that leverage graphical terminal interfaces effectively. Explore inventory systems, combat displays, map navigation, and other MUD features enhanced by visual terminal capabilities. ultrathink`
`/research Existing successful terminal-based games and MUDs with graphical interfaces for inspiration and implementation patterns. Analyze their approaches to HUDs, visual feedback, and player engagement through terminal graphics. ultrathink`

Once they all are complete, give me a summary of all of the research that has been completed.
