# MudForge Framework - New Repository Roadmap

## Problem Statement
Create a modern TypeScript framework for building AI-powered text-based multiplayer games (MUDs) based on learnings from the SAMud project, enabling rapid development of telnet-accessible games with first-class NLP/AI NPC integration.

## Strategic Decision: New Repository vs Conversion
**RECOMMENDATION: Build new framework repository**

### Advantages of New Repo Approach
- **Preserves SAMud**: Keep working reference implementation intact
- **Clean Architecture**: Design framework APIs from scratch without legacy constraints
- **No Breaking Changes**: SAMud users unaffected during framework development
- **Clear Separation**: Framework vs implementation concerns properly separated
- **Community Appeal**: Easier to attract contributors to "framework" project
- **Validation Path**: Port SAMud as first example to validate framework completeness

## Framework Architecture

### Package Structure (Monorepo)
```
mudforge-framework/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/                 # @mudforge/core - Core framework
│   ├── cli/                  # @mudforge/cli - Scaffolding tools
│   ├── ollama/               # @mudforge/ollama - AI provider plugin
│   └── examples/             # @mudforge/examples - Reference implementations
├── docs/                     # Framework documentation
└── scripts/                  # Development tooling
```

### Core Components (@mudforge/core)
- **Game Engine**: MudGame base class with configuration management
- **Session Management**: Connection handling, authentication, presence tracking
- **World System**: Room, Exit, Player abstractions with database persistence
- **Command Framework**: Plugin-based command registration and dispatch
- **Event System**: Extensible event-driven architecture for plugins
- **Database Layer**: Migration-based schema with provider abstraction
- **AI Integration**: Provider-agnostic interface for NPC AI systems

### Developer Experience (@mudforge/cli)
```bash
# Create new MUD
npx @mudforge/cli create my-mud --template basic

# Add AI capabilities
npx mudforge add ollama

# Generate content
npx mudforge generate world --theme "space-station"
npx mudforge generate npc --name "Captain" --room bridge

# Development server
npm run dev
```
