# Problem Statement
Transform SAMud from a traditional text-based MUD into a graphical, immersive telnet experience with static HUD displays, colorful ASCII graphics, persistent status information, and enhanced game mechanics while maintaining full telnet compatibility.

# Impacted Code Areas
- src/server/session.ts :: Core session handling needs ANSI escape sequence management, screen region control, and HUD rendering
- src/server/server.ts :: Telnet option negotiation, window size detection, and graphical welcome banner enhancements
- src/commands/commandDispatcher.ts :: Command output formatting for graphical display, status updates, and HUD refresh coordination
- src/commands/worldCommands.ts :: Room descriptions with ASCII art, visual movement feedback, and graphical map displays
- src/commands/chatCommands.ts :: Formatted chat output that preserves HUD display areas
- src/models/room.ts :: Enhanced room data structure for ASCII art, visual elements, and graphical metadata
- src/models/player.ts :: Additional player state for HUD display (health bars, status indicators, equipment)
- package.json :: New dependencies for blessed, terminal-kit, telnetlib, and ASCII art libraries

# Patterns / Examples
- src/server/session.ts:127-141 :: Current claudePrompt() and showStatusLine() methods provide foundation for HUD system
- src/server/server.ts:38-69 :: Existing ANSI color usage in showWelcomeBanner() demonstrates color capability
- src/server/session.ts:164-176 :: Direction indicators with emoji already show graphical enhancement approach
- External blessed.js examples :: Node.js terminal UI framework for complex screen layouts
- VT100/ANSI terminal control :: Industry standard for cursor positioning and screen regions

# Risks / Constraints
- Terminal compatibility varies across telnet clients (PuTTY, Terminal.app, etc.)
- ANSI escape sequence support inconsistent in older clients
- Screen size differences require responsive design approach
- Performance impact of frequent screen redraws on slower connections
- Complexity increase may introduce bugs in existing stable command system
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with terminal graphics programming
- Potential breaking changes to existing player experience

# FAR Scores
- Factual: 4 (Well-researched terminal graphics techniques, existing library support)
- Actionable: 3 (Clear implementation path but significant complexity)
- Reliable: 3 (Proven techniques but implementation challenges expected)
- Relevant: 5 (Directly addresses user requirements for graphical enhancement)
- **Average:** 3.75

# INVEST Flags
- Too Large: true (Multi-month effort requiring architectural changes across entire codebase)
- Unclear Requirement: false (Clear vision provided with example image)
- Risky Area: true (Core session and display logic changes affect all user interactions)

# Testing Strategy
## Unit Tests
- ANSI escape sequence generation functions
- HUD component rendering logic
- Screen region calculation and cursor positioning
- Color scheme and formatting utilities
- Input handling without display disruption

## Integration Tests
- Full session lifecycle with graphical interface
- Command execution maintaining HUD integrity
- Multi-user scenarios with concurrent HUD updates
- Room transitions and visual state consistency
- Chat system integration with persistent display areas

## End-to-End Tests
- Telnet client compatibility testing (PuTTY, Terminal.app, others)
- Various terminal sizes and screen resolution handling
- Performance testing with multiple concurrent graphical sessions
- Accessibility testing for screen readers and terminal limitations

## Mocking Strategy
- Mock terminal capabilities for different client types
- Stub ANSI escape sequence output for test verification
- Mock screen dimensions for responsive layout testing
- Simulate network conditions for performance testing

## Tools and Libraries
- Vitest for unit and integration testing
- Playwright for terminal session automation
- blessed-contrib for testing complex terminal layouts
- ANSI escape sequence validation libraries
- Performance monitoring tools for real-time graphics assessment

## Recommended Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic ANSI color and positioning infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Static HUD implementation with player stats
3. **Phase 3**: ASCII art room descriptions and visual enhancements
4. **Phase 4**: Interactive graphical elements and animations
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced game mechanics leveraging visual interface
