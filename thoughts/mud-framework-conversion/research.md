# Problem Statement
Convert the existing SAMud structure into a reusable framework that allows developers to bootstrap their own MUD games while leveraging the Ollama NLP/AI integration for enhanced NPC interactions.

# Impacted Code Areas
- src/services/ollamaClient.ts :: Core AI integration that needs to be abstracted and configurable
- src/models/npc.ts :: NPC model requires abstraction to support custom implementations
- src/commands/npcCommands.ts :: Command system needs to be extensible for custom NPC behaviors
- src/database/db.ts :: Database schema must be extensible for custom world data
- src/database/seed.ts :: Seeding logic needs templating for custom worlds
- src/server/server.ts :: Server initialization requires plugin/module system
- src/commands/commandDispatcher.ts :: Command registration needs plugin architecture
- src/types/index.ts :: Type definitions need to be exportable for framework consumers
- package.json :: Dependencies must be split between framework core and example implementation
- CLAUDE.md :: Documentation needs to be framework-oriented rather than SAMud-specific

# Patterns / Examples
- src/commands/commandDispatcher.ts :: Existing modular command registration pattern to extend
- src/services/ollamaClient.ts :: Service abstraction pattern for AI providers
- src/models/* :: Model pattern that can be converted to base classes/interfaces
- src/database/db.ts :: Migration system that can be extended for custom schemas
- Express.js middleware pattern :: Reference for plugin/middleware architecture
- Discord.js bot framework :: Reference for command registration and event handling
- Next.js create-next-app :: Reference for scaffolding tool design

# Risks / Constraints
- **Breaking Changes**: Converting to framework will break existing SAMud implementation
- **Complexity Increase**: Framework abstraction adds layers that may complicate simple use cases
- **Documentation Burden**: Framework requires extensive documentation and examples
- **Backward Compatibility**: Need migration path for existing SAMud installations
- **Ollama Dependency**: Framework tightly couples to Ollama; should consider provider abstraction
- **Performance Overhead**: Framework abstraction layers may impact response times
- **Type Safety**: Maintaining TypeScript type safety across plugin boundaries
- **Testing Complexity**: Framework testing requires mocking various configurations
- **Version Management**: Framework versioning and dependency management complexity

# FAR Scores
- Factual: 5 (Based on concrete codebase analysis and established patterns)
- Actionable: 5 (Clear implementation path with specific components to modify)
- Reliable: 4 (Well-tested patterns from other frameworks, some uncertainty in MUD-specific needs)
- Relevant: 5 (Directly addresses the requirement to create a reusable framework)
- **Average:** 4.75

# INVEST Flags
- Too Large: true (Requires major architectural refactoring across multiple components)
- Unclear Requirement: false (Clear goal to create framework with Ollama integration)
- Risky Area: true (Major breaking changes, complex abstraction requirements)

# Testing Strategy

## Unit Tests
- **Framework Core Tests**: Test base classes, interfaces, and plugin system
  - Mock implementations of MudGame, NPCManager, CommandRegistry
